# image_pipeline
Image Processing Pipeline with Threaded I/O and Multiprocessed Filters

1.	Controller starts:
	â€¢	A thread pool for loading images
	â€¢	A process pool for filtering
	â€¢	A thread pool for saving output
2.	Queues connect:
	â€¢	Threaded loaders â†’ put into processing_queue
	â€¢	Workers â†’ get from processing_queue, apply filter, put into output_queue
	â€¢	Threaded savers â†’ get from output_queue and write to disk
3.	Graceful shutdown after all tasks are done

â”œâ”€â”€ workers.py           # multiprocessing logic
â”œâ”€â”€ io_threads.py        # I/O threading for load/save
â”œâ”€â”€ images/              # input images
â””â”€â”€ output/              # processed output

1.	Loads images from a folder using threads (I/O-bound task)
2.	Sends the images to worker processes that apply filters like grayscale or blur (CPU-bound)
3.	Saves the processed images using threads again
4.	Uses a master controller process to orchestrate it all
